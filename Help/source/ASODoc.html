    <h2>Short description</h2>
    This mod is a continuation of Nature of the beast mod. This mod add
    many sophisticated and original spells, abilities and mechanics that
    will revolutionize your gameplay.<br>
    <br>
    There are 3 major parts of the mod that however are interconnected
    with one another:<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Beast part</h3>
    <br>
    This part adds several biological abilities and is best for werewolf
    players or werebeast players to be precise (for there are several
    werebeast forms available). It should also suit players that play as
    other beast races both vanilla (vampires, argonians, khajiits) and
    custom. The purpose of this part of the mod is to give the player
    the feeling he/she is really playing as a beast and even to command
    a horde of other beasts, to empower the player and to let him/her
    experience the Skyrim as never before. Dont let the above fool you.
    You can add any lesser power no matter what race you are playing. <br>
    <br>
    In practice you can gain: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>an automatic and immersive night eye that gradually turns on
            and off night eye effect depending on the amount of light on the
            player,</li>
        <li>a realistic smell that depends on the strength and direction
            of wind and allows you to track
            targets/plants/ingredients/food(even when in
            containers)/water/fire/etc from significant distance while
            providing you with many informations about them. Be advise
            though, you can be smelled as well even while not having the
            smell lesser powers,</li>
        <li>adrenaline surge that makes you faster (2 versions: turbo or
            slow-motion), stronger, increases jump height and reduces fall
            damage at the cost of stamina,</li>
        <li>6th sense that warns you when you are about to get hit either
            in melee, by spell or arrow and can trigger the above adrenaline
            surge if you choose so (if you choose slow-motion version of
            adrenaline surge you have a good chance to dodge the attack),</li>
        <li>realistic heat vision that takes into account events like
            death, swimming and rain (not under roof - roof detection!) and
            gradually turns on or off visual effects on nearby targets (when
            swimming the change is instant). Be advise though, some actors
            you can sense your heat as well even while you dont have the
            heat sense lesser powers</li>
        <li>lesser power allowing you to transform into alpha werewolf and
            back at will,</li>
        <li>chance to live as an Alpha Werewolf indefinatelly, to eat,
            drink and sleep in this form,</li>
        <li>chance to amass a wolf/werewolf pack consisting of wolves and
            werewolves you meet while being in Alpha (or vanilla) Werewolf
            form and command the pack by issuing simple commands like wait,
            follow me, wait there and forward (and with Moonlight Tales much
            more),</li>
        <li>chance to live as a Green Bane (giant monstrous yet stealthy
            lizard) indefinatelly, to eat, drink and sleep in this form, the
            lizard has its own unique abilties like camouflage (partial
            invisibility), spit, burrow and poisoned claws,</li>
        <li>chance to live as a mighty Werebear indefinatelly, to eat,
            drink and sleep in this form;</li>
        <li>chance to live as a flying, winged dragorian and to hunt in
            this form like eagles do;</li>
        <li>chance to climb trees/buildings, sneak in the beast form;</li>
        <li>chance to meet a green bane and learn the true meaning of
            terror or to meet your best pet ever. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Minion system part</h3>
    minion system is a system that allows the player to control
    different kind of actors such as followers/hirelings/follower pets/
    summoned or reanimated creatures (minions). It is perfect for any
    player that wants to play as a commander / necromancer / summoner /
    constructor commanding different kind of actors<br>
    <br>
    In practice you can gain: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>ability to command followers/hirelings/follower dogs/summmons
            without fighting yourself (wait, wait there, follow, forward,
            attack commands via custom buttons);</li>
        <li>ability to make your more advanced minions a labor force that
            harvest, mine, process and sell resources (including crafting
            and upgrading items, cooking, making camp etc)</li>
        <li>new necromantic spells that raise/summon undead or create soul
            reavers - harvesters of souls</li>
        <li>summoning spell to summon your minions from afar</li>
        <li>portal spell that allows you to send minions to different
            places </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3> Dwemer pack</h3>
    allows you to craft and use state of the art dwemer weapons and
    equipment<br>
    <br>
    In practice you can gain access to:<br>
    <ul>
        <li> dwemer automatic projectile launcher - a crossover between
            automatic rifle and railgun - very sophisticated and powerfull,
            uses 5 types of ammo, needs energy (form soul gems) to operate,
            has a clip of 24 bullets, 2 fire modes, can be reloaded any time</li>
        <li>other types of rifles (sniper, shotgun, gattling
            cannon)/thrower (flame/cryo/arc)</li>
        <li>dwemer mechanical sword (chain sword) - again requires energy
            (form soul gems) to operate properly</li>
        <li>heavy exploding bolts and arrows (3 types) - pretty powerfull,
            transforms bows/crossbows into granade launchers (and make them
            usefull despite the automatic projectile launcher)</li>
        <li>dwemer explosive devices (mines) - very powerfull - can be
            deplayed, picked up, armed, disarmed, concealed and revealed and
            triggered both manually (with timer), remotely and by proximity</li>
        <li>command or meet actors (including hostile ones) that use the
            above weapons, including heavily armored dwemer terminators,</li>
        <li>use grenades</li>
        <li>repair destroyed dwemer constructs with repair tool and spare
            parts</li>
        <li>flying disk that uses energy and returns to the player when
            reaches target/distination, if powered, benefits from
            auto-targeting (without energy it is weaker and doesnt return)</li>
        <li>sophisticated dwemer equipment powered by dwemer
            generator:&nbsp;
            <ul>
                <li>dwemer generator (refuelled with distilled spiritis that
                    can be cooked at cooking pot) - equipment worn by player,
                    allows to recharge automatic projectile launcher, mechanical
                    sword, remote control rod, dwemer flying disc, powers other
                    dwemer equipment</li>
                <li>mechanical blade that when powered discharges energy</li>
                <li>mechanical shield that when powered creates energy barrier
                    in front of the player</li>
                <li>cloaking device - that renders the player almost
                    completely invisible and violantly deactivates when in
                    contact with water</li>
                <li>different kind of head equipments that give you different
                    kind of vision modes, zoom and some enhanced hearing, water
                    breathing, distracting sound and hologram decoy</li>
                <li>shoulder cannon (autotargetting with head equipment)</li>
                <li>warp device - spohisticated personal teleporter (both long
                    and short range)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>remotely controlled pocket demer scout spider that uses
            cloaking device and grenades</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>telekinetic barrier - a spell that creates in front of you
            impenetrable barrier</li>
        <li>advanced teleekinesis spell that allows you to grab items or

    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Powers</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Toggle Power</li>
        <li>Indefinite Time</li>
        <li>Silent<br>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Default Key</h4>
    <p>[</p>
        
    <h4>Active Power</h4>
    <p>press and release the key, turn on/off the power.(Usable on horse).</p>
    <h4>Passive Power</h4>
    <p>
        Hold the key 2 seconds to turn on/off the passive.<br>
        Passive Power turn on/off night eyes automaticaly depending to the light on the player.
    </p>
        
    <p>Night Eyes is activated and desactivated gradually.</p>
    
    <p><b>Customization</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Sensitivity of the light for the passive power</li>
        <li>Vision of the power (Strength and color)</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p><b>Misc Infos</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Passive night eye strength depends of the amount of light on the player
            but is also influanced by NightEyeStrength variable;</li>

        <li>If player doesnt have night eye lesser power, vampire hunter
            sight lesser power is used. If player doesnt have night eye
            lesser power and vampire hunter sight lesser power, werewolf
            night eye lesser powers is used;</li>
        <li>Night eye and passive night eye deactivates heat vision if
            heat sense image space modifier is turned on.</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    
    <h3> Wind</h3>
    <h4>Active Power</h4>
    <p>Ability to check wind is added to the player</p>
    
    <p><b>Customization</b>
    <ul><li>Winds scripts can be activated or desactivated.</li></ul></p>
    
    <h4>Functions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The wind changes every time when wheather changes.</li>
        <li>There are
            16 directions. For example north wind means it blows from north.</li>
        <li>There are five types of strength of the wind. The stronger the
            rarer. You cannot have a strong wind when the weather is
            classified as pleasant;</li>
        <li>In the Eastmarch and between 11:00 and 20:00 at random
            locations you will encounter the phenomenon of thermal columns
            (a stream of hot air going up). It affects the smell abilities
            of all actors. In other words you can detect actors that are
            lower of you than ussually but you will find it very difficult
            or impossible to sense actors that are higher of your position.
            The same applies to other actors.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3> Smell</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Automatically added to player if he has a "Night Eyes" lesser power or waterbreathing constant effect.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr>Rewritten Marker<hr>
    <ul>
        <li>If you press "]" button you activate a smell scan of nearby
            area. The key can be customised in the ring menu. You can also
            actiate the ability by choosing appropriate power in magic menu
            and pressing the power button;</li>
        <li>The ability shows direction and strenght of wind, direction
            you are currently heading (only in interiors) and detected
            NPCs/creatures/plants/ingreidents/food/water/fire/etc;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>If you hold the toggle button and then release it you
            activate/deactivate passive smell. It notifies you about random
            detected object every few sec. You can also turn it on or off by
            using appropriate lesser power. You can tweak
            PassiveSmellInterval (value 0-100) variable in the ring menu to
            determine the frequency of the ability;</li>
        <li>The ability depends on the direction and strength of
            wind;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The direction of the wind determines whether you can detect
            current object while being in exterior world space. For example
            when the wind is north it means that it blows from the north and
            that you can detect objects north of you. When no wind or in
            interior you can detect object no matter its position;</li>
        <li>The strength of wind affects how distant objects player can
            smell. The stronger the father. Maxdistance in interior =
            4000.0. Maxdistance in exterior =
            4000+4000+WindStrength.GetValue()*16000.0. This means that
            potentially the greatest range is 24000, but in practice unless
            you change the number of grids and cells being loaded the
            maximum number is 16000. Be warned changing the number of grids
            and cells in "Skyrim.ini" file can cause crashes and other
            problems;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The strength also affects the angle of detection (both
            vertical and horizontal). You can detect only objects that lie
            in the direction of wind. Max angle = 45 - (22*wind
            speed);&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The smell provides you with information about actor's name
            (only if you have learned its scent otherwise it will use word
            Known - for known non-unique actors or Unknown - for all unknown
            actors), race, sex, condition (whether its dead or alive, it
            informs about death if current actor died at least 6 hours ago)
            and intensity of the scent (in percent). I have decided to show
            intensity of scent because in my opinion there is no other
            realistic way. When using smell you can only determine whether
            the current scent is stronger or weaker. The stronger the scent
            the closer the source, and the weaker the scent the further the
            source. In addition the max range of smell is fluid and depends
            on the strength of wind. In other words, in order to determine
            distance to the source in meters or feets while using a smell
            you would have to in reality use some kind of calculator taking
            into account intensity of scent and strength of wind. As far as
            I know, there are no calculators in Skyrim. Smell detects if
            current NPC is a vampire. Smell detects if current NPC is a
            werewolf (works on vanilla werewolves and any custom that has
            werewolf immunity ability or werewolf change power, so you can
            detect your followers as werewolves while using Amazing Follower
            Tweaks). You can learn scents of actors by approaching them and
            aiming at them while passive smell is turned on but only if you
            can sense them (this a good way to mark actors as netralized).
            You can sense most kind of actors. You cannot sense ghosts or
            magic anomalies. You cannot use smell while swimming. You cannot
            smell actors that are swimming. When smelling other objects only
            name of the object and intensity is provided;</li>
        <li>After the smell sequance you have the option to track a
            specific object detected by the smell (added visual effect: red,
            blue, green or strong orange on tracked object that shows you
            only a direction and not the object itself which I think is more
            realistic). If you activate the smell again or you are unable to
            track object anymore for some time you turn off the smell track
            mode (the visual effect is removed immediatelly). While in smell
            tracking mode passive smell provides you with information only
            about tracked object if you can sense it (if not information is
            provided as default). If you initiate smell while passive smell
            is active and you sensed some object you are given an option to
            scan the surrounding area (classic smell ability) or skip that
            and immediately start to track the recently detected object;</li>
        <li>Some actors can smell you as well. This means once you are
            smelled deers/elks should run from you and aggressive, confident
            and hostile actors should come to you (sic!). While approaching
            them take into consideration the direction and strength of wind.
            Beware animals, argonians, khajjits, vampires and werewolves.
            They cannot detect you when you are swimming. If you enter a new
            interior world space you are initially almost impossible to
            detect, but it gradually changes with time when your scent
            spreads in new place. In other word at the beginning you have a
            natural advantage. It doesnt matter whether you have a smell
            ability. Even if you dont they can still sense you. You can turn
            on or off detection by some actors of the player by tweaking
            ActorSmellDetectionTurnedOn variable in the ring setup;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Modders can choose to add to their actors the ability to smell
            the player. In order to do so the race must have the following
            vanilla keywords: LinkCustom06, LinkCustom08, LinkCustom10;</li>
        <li>Be advised! The detection of player by actors requires a
            script to be run on any loaded actor and can potentially affect
            the speed of the game;</li>
        <li>While using the smell abilities you have the option to track
            closest drinkable water (searches for the same objects as Use
            water lesser power from IMPs More complex Needs or Realistic
            Needs and Diseases). Smell will in the first place try to locate
            water from waterfalls (fresh, spring water) if RND mod is
            activated. Remember to stand still for few seconds;</li>
        <li>You can detect fire while using smell. This fires are
            recognised by Frostfall as sources of heat;</li>
        <li>You can detect other resources like
            food/potions/plants/ingredients/organic containers, if none
            detected - resources in containers, if you are in werebear form
            honey has absolute priority;</li>
        <li>when using passive smell the detection goes as follows, first
            actors, if none detected - resources like
            food/potions/plants/ingredients/organic containers, if none
            detected - fire, if none detected - water, if none detected -
            resources in containers, if you are in werebear form honey has
            absolute priority</li>
        <li>You can cook a Scent Camouflage Potion while having 1 blue,
            purple and red mountain flower. The potion will completly hide
            your scent for some time, then the efects will gradually fade. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Adrenaline surge</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The mod will automatically add adrenaline surge ability to the
            player that has any night eye lesser power or waterbreathing
            constant effect;</li>
        <li>Temporarily increases your speed, increases maximum carry
            weight, increases your jump (but not if
            AdrenalineSurgeJumpHeight is set to 0), reduces fall damage and
            increases several combat stats but constantly damages
            stamina;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>You can turn it off at any time. Automatically turns off when
            your stamina drops below 10;</li>
        <li>If you press "-" button you turn on adrenaline surge. If you
            press "-" button again you turn off adrenaline surge. The key
            can be customised in the ring menu. You can also turn on or off
            the ability by choosing appropriate power in magic menu and
            pressing the power button;</li>
        <li>Two versions:
            <ul>
                <li>time slows down,</li>
                <li>time doesnt slow down but you move/attack faster;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You choose version by tweaking AdrenalineSurgeFast variable in
            ring settings;</li>
        <li>In the same way you can also change the
            AdrenalineSurgeJumpHeight (value from 100 to 500);</li>
        <li>As a rookie your physical condition is lower and you can use
            adrenaline surge for shorter period of time. When your level is
            below 21 you will receive additional damage to stamina. The
            lower your level the higher the damage;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>If you hold adrenaline surge button (Note: you dont have to
            have the adrenaline surge) you will launch the survival menu
            that will enable you to transform into werewolf form and back
            and to sleep anywhere, to use check wind, check needs status
            from IMPs More Complex Needs or Realistic Needs and Diseases and
            use weather sense from Frostfall, drink (use water from IMPs
            More Complex Needs or Realistic Needs and Diseases) and use ring
            menu to tweak mod settings while in werewolf form.</li>
        <li>you cannot use adrenaline surge when flying as Dragorian</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>6th sense</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> The mod will automatically add 6th sense ability to the
            player that has any night eye lesser power or waterbreathing
            constant effect;</li>
        <li>It warns you if someone or something wants to attack you and
            provides you with direction of the threat. In other words the
            ability triggers when an actor is targeting the player;</li>
        <li>Two versions:
            <ul>
                <li>only notification (it is accompanied by sound effect),</li>
                <li>notification+trigger of adrenaline surge (player must have
                    adrenaline surge, adrenaline surge is triggered when enemy
                    is close or when enemy is attacking player from afar, so it
                    works separately from the notification, it is accompanied by
                    sound and visual effect);</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You choose version by tweaking 6thSenseOn variable in ring
            settings (value from 0 to 2, 0 = no 6th sense active);</li>
        <li>6th sense automatically turns off adrenaline surge when no one
            is attacking the player. In such case automatic adrenaline surge
            is immediately possible;</li>
        <li>6thSenseAdrenalineInterval (value from 0 to 360) value
            determines how much time must pass before 6th sense can trigger
            adrenaline surge again. You can change the variable in ring
            settings;</li>
        <li>SixthSenseInterval (value 5-100) value determines frequency of
            spamming the message. You can change the variable in ring
            settings;</li>
        <li>SixthSenseChance (value 1-100) value determines chance to
            detect the threat. You can change the variable in ring settings;</li>
        <li>Be advised! 6th sense requires a script to be run on many
            loaded actors and can potentially affect the speed of the game;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Heat sense</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The mod will automatically add Heat sense ability to the
            player that has waterbreathing constant effect;</li>
        <li>Heat sense detects living creatures and constructs which skins
            currently emits heat radiation. That means you cannot detect
            creatures that are swimming or are wet because its
            raining/snowing;</li>
        <li>You can detect if the rain/snow falls on current actor, actors
            beneath a roof will not be detected as wet;</li>
        <li>You cannot detect living creatures through walls;</li>
        <li>Actors will gain or loose heat depending on cicrumstances and
            the change of temperature will be visible. For example actor's
            heat signature after death will become less and less visible
            until it disapears completely. The same is with actors when its
            rainng. When swimming actor looses heat instantly. Actors that
            start to gain heat will become visible after some time, but
            again it will be a gradual process;</li>
        <li>If you press "=" button you turn on heat sense. If you press
            "=" button again you turn off heat sense. The key can be
            customised in the ring menu. You can also turn on or off the
            ability by choosing appropriate power in magic menu and pressing
            the power button;</li>
        <li>Even when you have not activated the heat sense there are
            spells and scripts that are constantly running. In order to stop
            them you must turn off heat&amp;rain tracking scripts via ring
            menu;</li>
        <li>Be advised! Heat sense is extremly complicated and requires
            many spells and magic effects to be run on any loaded actor and
            can potentially affect the speed of the game;</li>
        <li>you can turn on/off heat sense image space modifier (the blue
            screen effect) via the ring menu;</li>
        <li>heat vision deactivates night eye and passive night eye if
            heat sense image space modifier is turned on;</li>
        <li>some actors (argonians, argonian vampires and terminators) you
            can sense you as well even while you dont have the heat sense
            lesser powers</li>
        <li>you can craft a heat camouflage potion at cooking pot (death
            bell + nightshade). The potion will completly hide your heat for
            some time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Enhanced hearing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> The mod will automatically add enhanced hearing ability to
            Player that has any night eye lesser power or waterbreathing
            constant effect;</li>
        <li>it detects moving actors even through walls</li>
        <li>in addition it makes you hear the sounds better (by default
            volume of sounds is reduced by 30% and once the lesser power is
            activated the sound level is restored to default) - this is
            optional and can be turned off via the ring menu</li>
        <li>If you hold favor button ("\" by default) you turn on enhanced
            hearing. If you hold the button again you turn off enhanced
            hearing. The key can be customised in the ring menu. You can
            also turn on or off the ability by choosing appropriate power in
            magic menu and pressing the power button;</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Beasts</h2>
    <h3>Common Informations</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Climbing
            <ul>
                <li>while in any of the above beast forms you can climb</li>
                <li>to start climbing hold sprint control and press activate
                    control, you must be very close to perpendicular, straight
                    surface</li>
                <li>while climbing to move up press jump control</li>
                <li>while climbing to move down press sneak control</li>
                <li>in order to stop climbing (fall down) press ready weapon
                    control</li>
                <li>while climbing you do not regenerate stamina</li>
                <li>if you climb up while in Green Bane form you loose some
                    stamina</li>
                <li>if while climbing you hold sprint control and press
                    activate control you jump in the opposite direction to the
                    one you are currently facing</li>
                <li>if you press right while climbing on a tree you turn
                    right, if you press left while climbing a tree you turn left
                    (Warning: due to thickness of trees and sophistication this
                    not always work properly in such a case try turning in the
                    opposite direction)</li>
                <li>you cant sleep while climbing</li>
                <li>if someone hits you you fall</li>
                <li>you can eat honey, eggs etc (depending on beast form)
                    while climbing - just face the direction of the food and
                    press activate control</li>
                <li>the large trees from Flora overhaul mod are not supported
                    due to different thickness at lower and higher parts (but
                    you can always try)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Green Bane</h3>
    stealthy were-lizard (favorite tactic: ambush, hit&amp;run attacks
    with poisoned claws):<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li> If you have Green Bane transformation lesser power you can
            transform into Green Bane as many times as you like. Player when
            having green bane transformation has 100% resistance to disease
            and poison;</li>
        <li>If you have the Green Bane transformation lesser power that
            means that the heat sense spells and scripts wil be running in
            the background (see heat sense section above);</li>
        <li>You can gain a green bane disease that will transform you
            after 72 hours into green bane by being attacked by green bane
            NPC. The lesser power can be added via ring menu. When adding it
            you activate heat&amp;rain tracking scripts;</li>
        <li>Transforming causes nearby actors to be feared, the roar will
            not frighten player's allies. If you use Heart of the beast mod
            I suggest you to change the transformation howl sound fie of
            werewolf into roar (which is also provided) as it suits Green
            Bane better;</li>
        <li>Alternatively to transform you can hold adrenaline surge
            button (but only if you have the Green Bane transformation
            lesser powers) and choose transformation option;</li>
        <li>You can choose between vanilla, semi hardcore, hardcore and
            very hardcore transformation option. While in very hardcore
            transformation option during transformation all armour and
            cloths you wear are destroyed and everything else is dropped to
            the ground, it also causes player to loose all stamina, in
            hardcore transformation the clothes are not being destroyed, in
            semi hardcore transformation all items are placed in a sack at
            your feet, you can also tweak speed of transformation;</li>
        <li>If AutomaticAbilitiesAdjustmentOn is set to 1 (in the ring
            menu) during transformation all the above senses and abilities
            are automatically turned on and then when shifting back turned
            off. The variable can be tweaked via ring menu;</li>
        <li>While in Green Bane form you slightly faster regenarate
            health, have 100% disease and poison resistance, 100% more
            health and 0% more stamina, fortified unarmed damage (by 20) and
            you can carry much more (increase by 1000). In addition you have
            water breathing and 25% weakness to frost;</li>
        <li>Green Bane has increased jump height (250) and reduced fall
            damage as if using adrenaline surge, jumping depletes stamina of
            Green bane, running also slowly depletes stamina of Green bane.
            Green Bane is faster than Alpha Werewolf;</li>
        <li>Green Bane automatically stops running and drops camouflage
            when stamina is below 5, Green Bane automatically activates
            adrenaline surge via 6th sense only for a short period of time;</li>
        <li>You can be in the Green Bane form as long as you like;</li>
        <li>You can feed on animals and NPCs and you can eat any
            meat/eggs/fishes, eating gives 5 or 2 hp per second for 1 minute
            depending on what you eat;</li>
        <li>While feeding you eat venison or leek (compatibility with IMPs
            More Complex Need, but only Steam Workshop version and with
            Realistic Needs and Diseases), Frostfall recognises you as a
            beast with all the benefits of vanilla werewolf;</li>
        <li>You can drink, transform back, check current status and sleep
            by holding adrenaline surge button while in Green Bane form (in
            short you can live forever in Green Bane form using IMPS More
            Complex Needs or Realistic Needs and Diseases). The survival
            menu will enable you to transform into werewolf form and back
            and to sleep anywhere, to use check wind, check needs status
            from IMPs More Complex Needs or Realistic Needs and Diseases and
            use weather sense from Frostfall, drink (use water from IMPs
            More Complex Needs or Realistic Needs and Diseases) and use ring
            menu to tweak mod settings;</li>
        <li>You gain a 2-tier roar, tier 1 - fools nearby actors to
            investigate the targeted area, tier 2 - frightens nearby actors;</li>
        <li>You get the camouflage lesser power, to activate or deactivate
            hold down heat sense button ("=" by default and can be changed
            in the ring menu);</li>
        <li>The camouflage is essentially a partial invisibility. You
            become invisible but at close range actors that arent blind can
            detect you if they have line of sight;</li>
        <li>The range at which you can be detected depends on the amount
            of light and whether its raining or snowing. The darker it is
            the smaller the range. Rain and snow double the range. Level of
            Sneak skill also influances Camouflage. The higher the skill the
            more difficult is to spot you. Sneak exceeding 100 will not
            count (Range =
            (150+Player.GetLightLevel()*10)-(Game.GetPlayer().GetActorValue("Sneak")
            as int)*16). You can always be spotted in broad light at close
            range or at range of 150 (activation range);</li>
        <li>alpha effect of camouflage for green bane (visibility of the
            beast for the player) differs depending on environment
            (rain/snow but not light) and skill</li>
        <li>The camouflage will not hide you from actors that have smell.
            They will approach you, spot you and then attack you;</li>
        <li>While using the camouflage you do not regenerate stamina;</li>
        <li>While moving and not running with Sneak at least 30 or running
            with Sneak at least 60 or sprinting with Sneak at least 90 you
            slowly gain Sneak and your movement is muffled. Even if your
            sneak is below 30 and you walk you still slowly gain Sneak;</li>
        <li>Every blow landed by Green bane slightly increases OneHanded
            skill, progress system for beast forms recognises legendary
            skills as 100 skills;</li>
        <li>Damage increases with OneHanded skill: 140% (if OneHanded
            &gt;= 20), 180% (if OneHanded &gt;= 40), 220% (if OneHanded
            &gt;= 60), 260% (if OneHanded &gt;= 80), 300% (if OneHanded
            &gt;= 100);</li>
        <li>Attacks ignore 25%(if OneHanded&gt;=30)/50%(if
            OneHanded&gt;=60)/75%(if OneHanded&gt;=90) of armor;</li>
        <li>Power attacks disarm victim if Player's OneHanded &gt;= 70
            (50% chance);</li>
        <li>Power attacks have 25% chance to stunn target for 10 sec if
            Player's OneHanded &gt;= 100 but not when blocking hit from
            ahead;</li>
        <li>Power attacks will stagger vampire lord, turn it around and
            thus expose it to leathal blows</li>
        <li>Attacks from behind and sides do 3(if Sneak&gt;=20)/6(if
            Sneak&gt;=40)/9(if Sneak&gt;=60)/12(if Sneak&gt;=80)/15(if
            Sneak&gt;=100) times as much damage depending on the level of
            Sneak and increase Sneak level;</li>
        <li>Attacks on sleeping/paralyzed do 20(if Sneak&gt;=20)/40(if
            Sneak&gt;=40)/60(if Sneak&gt;=60)/80(if Sneak&gt;=80)/100(if
            Sneak&gt;=100) times as much damage depending on the level of
            Sneak and increase Sneak level;</li>
        <li>Green Bane claws apply poison to every target that is not
            construct, daedra or undead. Victim doesnt regenerate health,
            stamina and magicka. 1hp, 2 sp and 2mp is lost per second, no
            poison is applied if target is blocking a blow from ahead, after
            the poison has finished working (target has been cured) it
            cannot be posioned for 1 hour;</li>
        <li>you can use poison 10 times per 24 hours by holding vanilla
            sprint control or by entering infect mode;</li>
        <li>you can enter infect mode by holding sprint control and
            pressing ready weapon control while looking down (an alternative
            way of using poison), do so gain to escape the mode</li>
        <li>you can check the status of spit and poison via the survival
            menu (use check status option)</li>
        <li>After 1st stage the victim's sight becomes obscured so it wont
            be able to spot you when you use camouflage. After 2nd stage the
            victim becomes completly blind. After 3rd stage the victim
            becomes paralysed. The length of the poison stages depends on
            the base health of victim (length =
            20.0*(target.GetBaseActorValue("health")/100)). The end of 2
            first stages can be detected by watching the victim since it
            will stagger for a moment. Poison lasts 1h in game;</li>
        <li>Other modders can deny the player the option to transform via
            survival menu (which means the player will be trapped in the
            beast form) by setting the DenyTransformation global variable to
            1;</li>
        <li>while in Green Bane form you have access to progress info for
            Green Bane in the survival menu</li>
        <li>alternatively you can transform back by holding sprint control
            and pressing ready weapon control</li>
        <li>alternatively you can sleep while in the beast form by holding
            sprint control and pressing sneak control</li>
        <li>alternatively you can drink while in the beast form by holding
            sprint control, pressing sneak control and looking down</li>
        <li>after transforming back your previously equipped
            shout/power/lesser power is being equipped</li>
        <li>as green bane you gain spit ability - you can spit in face of
            other actor to blind it temporary (1 in-game hour cooldown
            period), to spit hold activate control and press crouch control
            - Fores New Idles in Skyrim - FNIS is required for this;</li>
        <li>you can tweak change of stats during transformation via the
            ring menu;</li>
        <li>slow metabolism - by holding down vanilla ready weapon control
            and pressing vanilla crouch control you can slow your
            metabolism, you exit this mode by repeating the key combination
            again;</li>
        <li>slow metabolism - makes you gradually loose heat and instantly
            hides your scent which makes you very difficult to find, however
            it also damages your stamina by 100 points and slows down your
            stamina regeneration;</li>
        <li>pressing vanilla crouch control in beast form
            activates/deactivates sneak mode.</li>
        <li>Burrow:
            <ul>
                <li>while in the green bane form you can burrow in the ground
                    (you cannot move or smell but you can use heat sense and
                    sleep/wait) - good for ambushes or safe sleep</li>
                <li>to activate hold sprint control and press activate control

                <li>Green bane no longer attacks player when he/she has green
                    bane transformation lesser power and when approaching the
                    player it gets registered into minion system, alternatively
                    you can use on it raise dead slave spell</li>
                <li>Green bane has 25% weakness to frost, increased healing

                <li>Green bane has poisoned claws that work on player the same
                    way they work on NPCs when you attack them in Green bane
                    form (loss of health, stamina, magicka, 2 stages of

                    try to evade it</li>
                <li>Green bane will not find you if it cannot see (you are

    <h3> Werebear </h3>
    (favorite tactic: frontal assaut):<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li> If you have Werebear transformation lesser power you can
            transform into Werebear as many times as you like;</li>
        <li>The Werebear transformation lesser power can be added via ring
            menu;</li>
        <li>Transforming causes nearby actors to be feared, the howl will
            not frighten player's allies, the fear effect is 50% more
            powerfull than in case of Alpha werewolf/Green bane;</li>
        <li>Alternatively to transform you can hold adrenaline surge
            button (but only if you have the Werebear transformation lesser
            powers) and choose transformation option;</li>
        <li>If AutomaticAbilitiesAdjustmentOn is set to 1 (in the ring
            menu) during transformation all senses and abilities (except for
            the heat vision and adrenaline surge) are automatically turned
            on and then when shifting back turned off. The variable can be
            tweaked via ring menu;</li>
        <li>You can choose between vanilla, semi hardcore, hardcore and
            very hardcore transformation option. While in very hardcore
            transformation option during transformation all armour and
            cloths you wear are destroyed and everything else is dropped to
            the ground, it also causes player to loose all stamina, in
            hardcore transformation the clothes are not being destroyed, in
            semi hardcore transformation all items are placed in a sack at
            your feet, you can also tweak speed of transformation;</li>
        <li>While in Werebear form you slightly faster regenarate health,
            have frost (50%) and disease (100%) resistance, 200% more health
            and 50% stamina, fortified unarmed damage (by 40) and you can
            carry much more (by 3000);</li>
        <li>Werebear has increased jump height (150) and reduced fall
            damage as if using adrenaline surge, Werebear is bigger and
            heavier than Alpha werewolf and has longer reach of arms.
            Werebear is slower than Alpha Werewolf;</li>
        <li>You can be in the Werebear form as long as you like;</li>
        <li>You can feed on animals, NPCs and eat plants/food/ingredients
            (in short almost everything), eating gives 5 or 2 hp per second
            for 1 minute depending on what you eat;</li>
        <li>While feeding on actors you eat venison and while feeding on
            plants/fishes/eggs/ingredients/food you eat leek (compatibility
            with IMPs More Complex Need, but only Steam Workshop version and
            with Realistic Needs and Diseases), Frostfall recognises you as
            a beast with all the benefits of vanilla werewolf;</li>
        <li>werebear LOVES honey (like Winnie the Pooh) and can eat it
            directly from bee hives. Such meal gives it a boost of 50+
            health and 100+ stamina for 15 minutes. Honey has absolute
            priority when smelling as a werebear;</li>
        <li>eating plants/ingredients/fishes/eggs/food slightly increases
            alchemy skill;</li>
        <li>You can drink, transform back, check current status and sleep
            by holding adrenaline surge button while in Werebear form (in
            short you can live forever in Werebear form using IMPS More
            Complex Needs or Realistic Needs and Diseases). The survival
            menu will enable you to transform into werebear form and back
            and to sleep anywhere, to use check wind, check needs status
            from IMPs More Complex Needs or Realistic Needs and Diseases and
            use weather sense from Frostfall, drink (use water from IMPs
            More Complex Needs or Realistic Needs and Diseases) and use ring
            menu to tweak mod settings;</li>
        <li>After transformation you receive 1 tier shout. Tier 1 - fear
            all nearby, the fear effect is 50% more powerfull than in case
            of Alpha werewolf/Green bane;</li>
        <li>While sprinting you knock back almost everything on your path</li>
        <li>Every blow landed by Werebear slightly increases OneHanded
            skill, progress system for beast forms recognises legendary
            skills as 100 skills;</li>
        <li>Damage increases with OneHanded skill: 140% (if OneHanded

            &gt;= 100);</li>
        <li>Attacks ignore 25%(if OneHanded&gt;=30)/50%(if
            OneHanded&gt;=60)/75%(if OneHanded&gt;=90) of armor;</li>
        <li>Attacks slightly stagger target if its level&lt;30 and
            Player's OneHanded&gt;=30, slightly stagger target if its
            level&gt;=30 and Player's OneHanded&gt;=60, moderately stagger
            target if its level&lt;30 and Player's OneHanded&gt;=60 but not
            when blocking hit from ahead</li>
        <li>Power attacks disarm victim if Player's OneHanded &gt;= 50
            (50% chance);</li>
        <li>Power attacks have 50% chance to stunn target for 10 sec if
            Player's OneHanded &gt;= 100 but not when blocking hit from
            ahead;</li>
        <li>Power attacks will stagger vampire lord, turn it around and
            thus expose it to leathal blows</li>
        <li>Sideways&amp;forward power attacks hit all targets in front of
            Player if Player's OneHanded &gt;= 70.</li>
        <li>While moving and not running with Sneak at least 30 or running
            with Sneak at least 60 or sprinting with Sneak at least 90 you
            slowly gain Sneak and your movement is muffled. Even if your
            sneak is below 30 and you walk you still slowly gain Sneak;</li>
        <li>Attacks from behind and sides do 3(if Sneak&gt;=20)/6(if
            Sneak&gt;=40)/9(if Sneak&gt;=60)/12(if Sneak&gt;=80)/15(if
            Sneak&gt;=100) times as much damage depending on the level of
            Sneak and increase Sneak;</li>
        <li>Attacks on sleeping/paralyzed do 20(if Sneak&gt;=20)/40(if
            Sneak&gt;=40)/60(if Sneak&gt;=60)/80(if Sneak&gt;=80)/100(if

        <li>you can reduce unarmed damage to 0 by holding sprint control
            and pressing ready weapon control while looking down (good for
            infecting other with beast disease), do so gain to escape the
            mode;</li>
        <li>you can tweak change of stats during transformation via the

    <h3>Alpha Werewolf </h3>
    (favorite tactic: hunting in pack):<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li> If you have Alpha Werewolf transformation lesser power you
            can transform into Alpha Werewolf as many times as you like;</li>
        <li>The Alpha Werewolf transformation lesser power is added
            automatically if you have werewolf change power (you are
            werewolf). It can be added via ring menu;</li>
        <li>Note that this transformation is completely separate from
            vanilla and technically it turns you into custom race called
            Alpha Werewolf;</li>
        <li>Transforming causes nearby actors to be feared, the howl will
            not frighten player's allies;</li>

            Alpha werewolf howls fortify health by 20 points and stamina by
            100 points of all your wolves/werewolves for 60 sec;</li>
        <li>Note that tier 2 shout is not a conjuration spell. It will

            infecting other with beast disease), do so gain to escape the
            mode;</li>
        <li>you can tweak change of stats during transformation via the
            ring menu;</li>
        <li>activating werewolf or wolf when it is holding position (see
            minion system section) and when you hold down vanilla sprint
            control releases the actor;</li>
        <li>pressing vanilla crouch control in beast form
            activates/deactivates sneak mode</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Dragorian </h3>
    (favorite tactic: death from above)<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li> to play as ths race you must choose Argonian race and add
            Dragorian transformation lesser power via the ring menu that
            allows you to transform back and forth</li>
        <li>Dragorian has wings and can fly
            <ul>
                <li>to start flying you should start running (be on auto move
                    and always running - dont press forward and run vanilla
                    controls) and quickly press vanilla jump control (dont hold
                    it)</li>
                <li>to stop flying press either jump (or run or back vanilla
                    control but jump is recommended)</li>
                <li>there are 3 speed modes: slow (hold down vanilla activate
                    control), normal and fast (hold down vanilla sprint control)</li>
                <li>in addition you gain speed while flying down and loose
                    speed when flying up, the higher arc the greater difference</li>
                <li>you gain and loose speed gradually, in slow speed mode you
                    loose speed quicker</li>
                <li>hitting obstacles can cause serious injuries, especially
                    when you are not in the slow mode, the greater the speed,
                    the greater damage</li>
                <li>you can glide&nbsp;
                    <ul>
                        <li>you start and stop gliding by pressing vanilla sneak
                            control</li>
                        <li>while gliding you move silently but your speed is
                            reduced by 25%</li>
                        <li>while gliding you will always at least slightly go
                            down unless you move with great speed (this will be
                            temporary since you will slow down quickly) or unless
                            you experience thermal column effect</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>you can attack targets with your clawed feets, there are 3
                    options:&nbsp;
                    <ul>
                        <li>attack and land (hold vanilla left attack control)</li>
                        <li>attack and continue fly (hold vanilla right attack
                            control)</li>
                        <li>grab - only actors about the sameweight or lighter
                            (hold down vanilla right or left attack control and then
                            hold down vanilla sprint control, release either of the
                            above controls to release prey for its doom)</li>
                        <li>all attacks inflict damage upon impact, the greater
                            speed, the greater damage, attacks from behind or side
                            deal 300% damage</li>
                        <li>you can even strike hawks in the air</li>
                        <li>grab also inflicts 5 pts of damage per second</li>
                        <li>in order to attack succesfully you must initiate
                            sequance with appropriate timing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>you can auto rotate (make circles) - to do so press either
                    strafe left or strafe right button</li>

                    camera mode</li>
                <li>you cannot use adrenaline surge when flying</li>
            </ul>

            gives all senses of alpha werewolf, adrenaline surge, climbing,
            improves jump height/reduces fall damage and command howls (no

            below about the minion system) you will gain its eqivalent in

        <li>as vampire lord you may "benefit" from 3 types of hardcore
            transformations if you turn them on via the ring menu (see
            section above about alpha werewolf)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Minions system</h2>
    <h3> Main part</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li> You can issue simple commands to above wolves/werewolves and
            any creature you summoned in vanilla way either with vanilla or
            custom spells as well as to followers/hirelings/follower dogs
            both custom and vanilla (minions) no matter what race you are or
            whether you transformed into alpha werewolf. The commands can be
            added or removed via ring menu. Up to 25 (sic!) minions
            supported (but havent tested it). The mod detects them
            automatically. You dont have to be alpha werewolf to use this</li>
        <li>The minions will hear your commands if distance is less than
            4000, except for follow, where the distance is 8000 (150 is
            activation distance)</li>
        <li>Follow me / all follow me - minions will follow you, default
            key: ",", when you order a minion to retreat it will disengage
            from combat until it reaches you</li>
        <li>Wait / all wait - minions will stop where they are, default
            key: "."</li>
        <li>Wait there / all wait there - minions will stop where you
            point, default key: ";", just like in case of forward command
            you cansee where the actor will go. The marker is optional and
            can be turned off in the ring menu</li>
        <li>Forward / all forward - minions will go where you point them
            and will return after few seconds unless they find enemy,
            default key: "/" - advanced minion are put into hyper favor mode
            (see below)</li>
        <li>While you lock on specific target (using lock on target lesser
            power or pressing LockOnTargetButton - "'" and looking in the
            direction of some actor, note that it will be highlighted and
            some info about it will be provided via notification) and give
            some minion/minions a forward command, it/they will attack the
            target, actors hostile to the player and actor nearest to the
            player have the highest priority. When you press the lock on
            target button again you switch to another target. In order to
            turn off lock on target you must loose the eye contact with it
            or kill it. Attack command for minions (followers) takes into
            account their morality, if a minion has morality &gt; 0 and is
            ordered to attack a target not hostile to the player the minion
            will not obey and its relationship with the player will
            deteriorate</li>
        <li>If you issue command to single minion only the minion that is
            following you will obey the command unless the commmand you are
            giving is follow me</li>
        <li>You issue the commands via shout button, but you can also
            issue follow me, wait and forward commands via buttons you
            define in the ring menu. In werewolf form you can issue all
            follow me and all forward commands using the shout (see above)</li>
        <li>you can heal advanced minions (including followers but not
            constructs) if it is damaged and you give it healing potion or
            even cure poison (if it is poisoned and you give it cure poison
            potion) - not undead or dwarven constructs</li>
        <li>advanced minions can use poisons to enhance their equipped
            weapons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Squads</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can assign minions to squads and issue them commands
            separetly</li>
        <li>If you hold follow me button or use appropriate lesser power
            you choose next minion group as a group that you will give
            orders (all, unassigned, squad1, squad2, squad3)</li>
        <li>If you hold wait button or use appropriate lesser power you
            choose previous minion group as a group that you will give
            orders (all, unassigned, squad1, squad2, squad3)</li>
        <li>You can also select specific minion group using select all,
            select unassigned, select Squad1, select Squad2 and select
            Squad3 lesser power</li>
        <li>While issuing commands whether to all or to single minion you
            will only issue commands to those that belong to the group you
            currently selected</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Minion group menu</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you hold forward button or use appropriate lesser power you
            activate minion group menu that allows you to administer minion
            squads, issue commands to a specific picked minion (only the
            first command no matter whether nominally its a command to all
            or to a single minion) or enter into dialogue with first
            appropriate minion</li>
        <li>You can tweak the CommandAll variable to determine if the
            commands issued via custom button are issued to all or to single
            minion from current group. You can also tweak the CommandAll
            variable by holding LockOnTargetButton</li>
        <li>You can now give orders to mounted minions and they will stay
            mounted, but you can also choose that they will dismount each
            time you give them order by tweaking command mounted/command
            dismounted variable in minion group menu or by holding
            MinionWaitThereButton. In order to actually command the mounted
            minions you have to download a mod that will make them mount a
            horse and follow you mounted like Amazing Followers Tweaks mod,
            you wont be able to succesfull give commands to mounted minions
            when using Convinient horses mod unless you disable Horses for
            followers option. Note: my mod doesnt include mounted combat -
            download Horsemen - Mounted Combat Enhancement to have that
            option</li>
        <li>via the menu you can select specific minion to issue it
            command</li>
        <li>In minion group menu you can change the level of aggression of
            all minions in selected group as well as a specific minion.
            There are 3 levels: not aggressive (will not attack unprovoked),
            aggressive (will attack enemies on sight), very aggressive (will
            attack any nonfriendly actors, only for one hour, detection of
            targets is slow, this doesnt apply to followers with morality
            above zero)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dialogue options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>you can access inventory and give specific commands to more
            advanced minions (followers, raised dead slaves, raised skeleton
            slaves, Moonlight Tales werewolves)</li>
        <li>In order to do so activate the minion and choose the option in
            the dialogue about instructions</li>
        <li>This way you can order minion to gather resources from other
            minions - all or of different types like crafting resources,
            survival equipment, ingredient, weapons, armor, keys,
            books/scrolls, food&amp;potions</li>
        <li>This way you can order minion to can sell items not currently
            used by that minion (at half of the price) - all or of different
            types like crafting resources, survival equipment, ingredient,
            weapons, armor, books/scrolls, food&amp;potions</li>
        <li>This way you can order the minion to set up/tear down camp,
            bring water (if the minion has watersacks from RND mod), bring
            your horse or chop wood from trees (if the minion has
            woodcutter's axe)</li>
        <li>If you have RND mod activated, depending what kind of
            equipment and how many the minion has different camp will be
            built (up to 5 traveller's tents and bedrolls, 1 tinderbox, 1
            cast iron pot, 3 wood piles are supported for full camp)</li>
        <li>You can tear down camp within 72 hours if you are close to it
            and in this way regain resources</li>
        <li>you can set the minion to do specific command for you ("I want
            you to do something for me")</li>
        <li>Alternativelly you can give the above commands by holding down
            forward command button (minion group menu) and choosing give
            command option or chosing a specific minio and pressing set to
            command. In this way the first advanced minion in the currently
            commanded minion group will be chosen</li>
        <li>you can warn nearby minions via minion group menu about nearby
            traps, this will make them not to trigger traps for 2 minutes
            (requires AFT mod to work)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Reserve subsystem</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>up to 100 minions can be unregistered from minion system and
            ordered to hold position by activating them (in case of
            followers and advanced minions via dialogue) - this is excellent
            for players with castles, camps etc</li>
        <li>activate them again to make them partol nearby area, activate
            them again to register them in the minion system once more</li>
        <li>you can also make the reserve minions to be registered in the
            minion system again by issuing follow command if current
            commanded group is all and the reserve minions are nearby, if
            you command a single minion only 1 reserve minion will be
            registered again, if all - as many as it is possible</li>
        <li>activating werewolf or wolf (registered by howling - see alpha
            werewolf section) when it is holding position and when you hold
            down vanilla sprint control releases the actor</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Subsquads subsystem</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>subsquads - each minion will be able to become a leader (via
            minion group menu), there can be up to 9 leaders</li>
        <li>subordinates of the leader (up to 11 minions from the same
            group) will be unregistered from the minion system and will
            follow the leader</li>
        <li>this means you can indirectly control additional 99 actors
            (9x11) - this is good for avoiding the cap of 25 minions</li>
        <li>if leader dies another leader is chosen from the subordinates</li>
        <li>you can add or remove actors from subsquad or change its
            leader</li>
        <li>you can make a minion a subsquad leader and then order it to
            patrol nearby area (Reserve subsystem)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Summoning of minions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the Dragonsreach you can find summon minions spell tome, if
            you have that spell a vampire lord version of it is added when
            you begin to hover while in the vampire lord form</li>
        <li>the spell summons to you distant minions, depending on current
            chosen group of minions and whether you command all or a single
            minion</li>
        <li>if you have chosen specific minion it will be summoned</li>
        <li>if summoned minion is a leader all its subordinates will be
            summoned</li>
        <li>if you choose to command all minions as a group you can also
            summon minions that have been put to reserve provided that the
            current number of minions in the main minion system is less than
            25, but first the minions in the main minion system will be
            summoned - this works both if you command all or single minion</li>
        <li>each additional summoned minion costs 50 points of magicka</li>
        <li>summoned minions will begin to follow you, if you have
            summoned a minion that has been put to reserve it will be
            registered in the main minion system&nbsp;</li>
        <li>In the Dragonsreach you can also find portal spell tome</li>
        <li>it will give you to portal spells - one to set destination of
            given portal and one to open portal. It will also give you
            lesser power to let you choose between 5 portals</li>
        <li>if you enter the portal by activating it all following minions
            will follow you</li>
        <li>if you order minions to wait there near the portal they will
            enter it and begin to patrol the area on the other side of the
            portal</li>
        <li>if you have the spells a vampire lord version of them is added
            when you begin to hover while in the vampire lord form</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Favor subsystem</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>advanced minions can be commanded to do additional things by
            aiming at object, up to 9 minions can perform favors at the same
            time</li>
        <li>just press favor button ("\" by default, can be changed in the
            ring menu) then aim and press the button again - REMEMBER NOT TO
            AIM FIRST! YOU MUST START TO AIM ONCE YOU PRESS THE FAVOR BUTTON
            THE FIRST TIME</li>

    <h3>Modder's support</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Modders can choose to enable their actors to be registered in
            the Minion system. In order to do so the actor must be in the
            following vanilla factions: MagicCharmFaction, DummyFaction and
            have the following vanilla keywords: TGMark,
            LinkWaitUntilTriggered (tip: keywords must be added in the CK
            but factions can be also added/removed via script and this
            allows great flexibility)</li>
        <li>By default the above minions added by other mod will not have
            the follow player&amp;keep distance package (just like followers
            - this is for compatibility purpose). In order to give it to the
            actor you must remove it from DummyFaction after registration
            but you can keep them in MagicCharmFaction faction (just wait 10
            seconds after adding the player to the faction so my spell can
            register the actor in the Minion system). In order to remove the
            package add them to DummyFaction again. Remember to order them
            to wait and to follow you again to reset the AI packages</li>
        <li>In order to unregister from the Minion system the above actor
            added by other mod the actor must have the following keywords:
            TGMark, LinkWaitUntilTriggered, be in faction DummyFaction and
            be removed from faction MagicCharmFaction;</li>
        <li>In order for the above registration/unregistration to take
            place the actor must be near the player for at least 5-10
            seconds</li>
        <li>Alternativally you can add an actor to the Minion system in
            the following way: </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>if Game.GetFormFromFile(0x000895C5, "Nature of the beast.esp")<br>SPELL ExteriorSpell1 = Game.GetFormFromFile(0x000895C5, "Nature of thebeast.esp") as SPELL<br>ExteriorSpell1.Cast(CurrentActor)</pre>

    <h2>Moonlight Tales compatibility patch</h2>

    informations for Moonlight Tales v2.03 (v2.33 not tested)<br>

    <br>

    <ul>

        <li>When you are a MT werewolf and have Notb2 alpha werewolf
            transformation, Notb2 alpha werewolf transformation is triggered in the
            night</li>
        <li>When you are a MT werebear and have Notb2 werebear
            transformation,
            Notb2 werebear transformation is triggered in the night</li>
        <li>When MT transforms you you cannot transform back at will</li>
        <li>the skin system from MT is not compatible with races from Notb2
            since all the skins are meant only for vanilla werewolf race which
            means if you transform into alpha werewolf from Notb2 or werebear from
            Notb2 you will not receive the skins from MT, this doesnt mean you
            cannot change (alpha) werewolf skin by downloading any texture mod</li>
        <li>when player to NPCs infection is turned on in Moonlight Tales
            alpha
            werewolf from Notb2 will infect NPCs with Sanies Lupius and werebear
            from Notb2 will infect NPCs with Sanies Ursius</li>
        <li>summon shout for werewolf/werebear NPCs is disabled when
            activating
            Notb2 for the first time or restarting the mod (you can turn it on via
            MCM menu of MT)</li>
        <li>While howling in Alpha werewolf (and in vanilla werewolf too with
            automatic abilities adjustment turned on) form you will make MT
            werewolves (but not MT werebears) your minions and you will be able to
            command them with howls, these minions are considered advanced minions
            - see minion system section for details</li>
        <li>Werewolf minions will transform with you back and forth</li>
        <li>if hardcore transformation is on MT werewolves/werebears will
            suffer
            the same consequences as player (stamina damage, loss of all cloths,
            dropping of everything else to the ground) if you tweak the range of
            transformation via the ring menu</li>
        <li>if fast transformation is on MT werewolves/werebears will
            transform
            faster if you tweak the range of transformation via the ring menu</li>
        <li>both Moonlight Tales werebears and werewolves have increased
            health,
            stamina, unarmed damage, muffled movement, frost resistance and 100%
            disease resistance, also they regenerate health</li>
        <li>Moonlight Tales werewolf/werebear attacks from behind are very
            leathal, power attacks can knock down, paralyse or disarm, in case of
            vampire lords they turn it around exposing to leathal blows from behind</li>
        <li>better Moonlight Tales werewolves/werebears - you have big chance
            to
            meet a werewolf pack consisting of 2-6 werewolves (with your progress
            the chance gets bigger and you have a chance to encounter a bigger
            pack), however werewolves are much weaker that werebears, you will
            rarely meet werewolf slightly stronger that the basic and even so only
            on higher level (with your progress the chances increase), werebears
            are left untouched except for the fact that they get additional
            protectio against frost</li>
        <li>smell identifies MT werebears</li>
        <li>the raised from death Monnlight Tales werewolves/werebears
            transform
            with you if you have any transformation lesser power or vanilla
            transformation power or if not will transform while in combat</li>
        <li>activating werewolf when it is holding position and when you hold
            down vanilla sprint control releases the actor </li>

    <h2>Bugs/issues</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Occasionally the smell ability can describe NPC as FOXRACE when its
            a humanoid. This is a Skyrim glitch not caused by the mod. This problem
            should be eliminated now, if not please notify me</li>
        <li>Sometimes the 6th sense will trigger adrenaline surge even when
            hostile actor is not attacking you but someone else. This is because it
            is enough for the actor to spot you to be technically in combat with
            you. I tried to limit this as much as I can, this will happen only when
            target can see you and is turned in your more or less exact direction.
            I dont know how to fix it completely but it should happen very rare.
            Sometimes 6th sense can trigger adrenaline surge too late for you when
            hostile actor is using ranged attack and is at medium distance</li>
        <li>Some quest stages or fights can require you to cast no spells.
            This
            is a problem, because although you cant see this the mod constantly
            causes the player to cast spells via scripts. This is so called brawl
            bug. In such case you have 3 options: 1) turn off the mod for
            appropriate time, 2) turn off for appropriate time all passive
            abilities (night eye, smell, 6th sense), wind script and detection of
            player by actors and minion script or 3) download and turn on Brawl Bug
            Plugin (see Recommended mods section above). Its quite easy now to turn
            off and on all abilities/scripts of the mod. You can do this in ring
            menu in maintenance section. Just remember to wait for the first punch.
            Currently I recommend to download Brawl Bugs Patch - Plugins - Modder
            Resource</li>
        <li>Minion system now covers also undead actors, but raise dead will
            not
            follow your commands due to the issues with thier AI. Their AI is
            hidden somewhere in the Skyrim engine and to my knowledge no one was
            able to overwrite/disable it so far. Only summoned actors will follow
            your commands. I have implemented a special scripted raise dead slave
            spell that can raise dead actors and allows you to command them via the
            Minion system;</li>
        <li>Occasionally you can get an eye glitch. Its a Skyrim glitch and
            not the fault of the mod. It can be removed by typing in "player.addspell
            000f71d1" followed by "player.removespell 000f71d1" in the console;</li>
        <li>Some people have experienced keybind saving problem. I was told
            that
            it seems to be effected by the position in the load order and that the
            position of my mod cannot exceed position 7F Hex (127 Dec). I havent
            tested it myself since I donot use such amount of mods myself;</li>
        <li>Some have experienced that the mod is not working (nothing worked
            and they even didnt have the ring) or that the smell in not working (no
            name, just brackets). The solution is restart my mod via the ring menu
            or to deactivate and activate my mod several times in mod manager
            (first turn it off via the ring menu) or if thats not working change
            load order. Alternativelly try this:
            http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/963218-how-would-one-go-about-reducing-papyrus-based-lag/
            The problem with smell seems to be fixed in ver. 2.6;</li>
        <li>Dont loot any container while in any of my beast forms. You
            shouldnt be able to do it in the first place but in case you can dont
            do it or you will loose that object forever. This mechanism was
            implemented to avoid exploits concerning feeding. In any beast form you
            are not supposed to pick anything. All you can in a beast form is to
            feed on something. From ver. 2.8 you loose only what you can eat;</li>
        <li>Some ENB mods can prevent nightvision effects from working. This
            is
            a problem that effects vanilla nightvision as well as vision effects
            from mods such as this. If you are using an ENB configuration, you must
            ensure that UseOriginalPostProcessing" is set to `1 in your
            enbseries.ini" file;</li>
        <li>From time to time smell tracking is turned off but the visual
            effect persists. I dont know why. I tried to fix it but I failed. If
            something like that happens you should start tracking again and then
            deactivate the tracking. This should fix it;</li>
        <li>Wispmother Smoke glitch - it appears very rarely, its a Skyrim
            glitch, to fix read this:
            http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/768741-wispmother-fx-glitch-fix/?p=6985690;</li>
        <li>Raise dead NPCs (humanoids) dissapear when left alone in
            different
            world space for too long but only NPCs from cities/villages (both
            guards and civilians), they can be recalled via the ring menu -
            bandits, hostiles from dungeons are not affected by the issue, this has
            propably something to do with vanilla Skyrim AI of the actors.<br>
